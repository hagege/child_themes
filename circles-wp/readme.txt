== Description ==

Circles WP is a clean, flexible, fast and accessibility-ready block theme. 
Its default look is a stylish white on black background color scheme with an orange circle in background and lexend font (a sans-serif typography). 
It is possible to change the background graphic with the Circles WP. 10 Circles WP with different colors are supplied in the \assets\images folder as SVG graphics.
Circles WP is built from the ground up for flexibility. It includes ten different theme styles to choose from, and different block patterns that you can use to quickly create unique page layouts. 
Circles WP is suitable for websites that contain few photos. The theme is therefore not suitable for photo-heavy websites.

Description: Circles WP is a clean, flexible, fast and accessibility-ready block theme. Its default look is a stylish white on black background color scheme with an orange circle in background and lexend font (a sans-serif typography). It is possible to easily change the background graphic in code-editor. Detailed instructions can be found on the following page: https://haurand.com/circles-wp-developing-a-block-theme/ 10 Circles WP with different colors are supplied in the \assets\images folder as SVG graphics. Circles WP is built from the ground up for flexibility. It includes ten different theme styles to choose from, and different block patterns that you can use to quickly create unique page layouts. If you use the “Blank Page” template, the theme can also be used on websites with lots of photos. Another alternative is to delete the background graphic for the group block or to use a more subtle color for a circle. This great flexibility characterizes the theme.

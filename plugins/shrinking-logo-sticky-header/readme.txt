Adds a sticky header with animated logo shrink effect. It is also possible to set a breakpoint for the mobile menu.

== Description ==

Shrinking Logo Sticky Header is a lightweight WordPress plugin developed specifically for Block Themes. 
It adds a modern sticky header with smooth, animated shrinking effects for both the header and the site logo. 
As users scroll down the page, the header and logo automatically reduce in size, maximizing on-screen space and keeping navigation easily accessible without disrupting the browsing experience.

The plugin allows you to individually configure the heights for the header and logo in both their normal and shrunken states, giving you full control over your siteâ€™s appearance. 
These settings can be easily adjusted to match your branding or design preferences.

One of the key advantages of Shrinking Logo Sticky Header is its simplicity: 
After activation, the sticky and shrinking effects work in principle immediately - no additional setup or configuration is required. 
This makes it ideal for users who want a professional, dynamic header effect without dealing with complex options or custom code.

In Version 1.1 I have added the option to set a custom breakpoint for mobile menu.

sorry, no. The classic themes usually already offer such options. 

= Is it possible to use this plugin for all Block Themes? =
Tested with Twenty Twenty-Three, Twenty Twenty-Four, Twenty Twenty-Five, Circles WP.

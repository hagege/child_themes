== Description ==

Circles is a clean, flexible, fast and accessibility-ready block theme. Its default look is a stylish white on black background color scheme with an orange circle in background and lexend  font (a sans-serif typography). Circles is built from the ground up for flexibility. It includes nine different theme styles to choose from, and different block patterns that you can use to quickly create unique page layouts. Circles is suitable for websites that contain few photos. The theme is therefore not suitable for photo-heavy websites.
